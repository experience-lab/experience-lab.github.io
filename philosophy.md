# Philosophy

What am I up to here? I'm not exactly sure. A simple reason is that for the past few years I've dabbled in digital art, especially using the javascript 3d graphics package [three.js](https://threejs.org/), and I want to put these creations somewhere convenient that I can share with people. But I also have a greater ambition with this metaproject, which is to create a kind of math and science museum on the web which inspires curiosity and exploration and is accesible to anyone with a computer and an internet connection.

The online world of science education and outreach is already vast, with most of it happening through videos on youtube. There are many excellent videos, but the medium lacks the interactive quality I'm trying to acheive. Modern web technology allows something in between passively consuming a video and doing, say, a home experiment.

Most online science content is also rather basic, and I think many of the most interesting topics in physics and math are almost never been broached. I'm talking about the deep concepts that have affected how we scientists view the world. For example spontaneous symmetry breaking, or renormalization. I make simulations so that I can see these things in action for myself. Then I can help others to see what I'm looking for in the simulation.

This is really more about inspiring than explaining, and for me it has an important aesthetic dimension. I remember browsing wikipedia as a teenager and becoming captivated by the language and symbols used to describe quantum field theory and the standard model.

<!-- One of my favorite museums is the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles, which is itself less of a museum than an aesthetic exploration of 19th century private collections. One exhibit concerns the work of a fictitious (or perhaps forgotten) memory theorist who supposedly developed a kind of geometrical theory of forgetting. Though the theory is never explained, something about the aesthetics of that theory nags at us until we are inspired to invent our own.
