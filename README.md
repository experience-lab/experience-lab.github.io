Welcome! This is a page for some interactive science/math visualizations/simulations I've written for the browser (these will likely not function on mobile). Below you will find some links. I plan to record some videos explaining how to use them.

# Dynamical Systems and Bifurcations

A dynamical system is composed of a space of configurations and a prescription for the time evolution of those configurations. One class of dynamical systems describes the configuration as a vector v in some n-dimensional vector space V and specifies the time evolution by giving a formula for the rate of change of v which looks like

where f is a function from V to V. It can be useful to picture f as a vector field on V, like the velocity field of some fluid. This equation then says that the system moves as would a mote in the flow.
