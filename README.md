Welcome! This is a page for some interactive science/math visualizations/simulations I've written for the browser (these will likely not function on mobile). Below you will find some links. I plan to record some videos explaining how to use them.

# Dynamical Systems and Bifurcations

A dynamical system is composed of a space of configurations and a prescription for the time evolution of those configurations. One class of dynamical systems describes the configuration as a vector v in
